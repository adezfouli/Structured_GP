Test MoG for diagonal approximation using Trung's code


==
Hi Edwin,

Here are the data for checking. It is a csv file, and first row is X, and the second row is Y.

It is a diagonal model with single component, and only MoG components are optimised. 

For the kernel, variance = 0.5, and length-scale = 0.2.

Likelihood is Gaussian with sigma = 0.2.

Number of samples = 10000

Cheers,
Amir

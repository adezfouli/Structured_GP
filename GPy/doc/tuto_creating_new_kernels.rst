Creating new kernels
********************

We will see in this tutorial how to create new kernels in GPy. We will also give details on how to implement each function of the kernel and illustrate with a running example: the rational quadratic kernel. 

Structure of a kernel in GPy
============================

In GPy a kernel object is made of a list of kernpart objects, which correspond to symetric positive definite functions. More precisely, the kernel should be understood as the sum of the kernparts. In order to implement a new covariance, the following steps must be followed

    1. implement the new covariance as a kernpart object
    2. update the constructors that allow to use the kernpart as a kern object
    3. update the __init__.py file

Theses three steps are detailed below.

Implementing a kernpart object
==============================

We advise the reader to start with copy-pasting an existing kernel and to modify the new file. We will now give a description of the various functions that can be found in a kernpart object.

**Header**

The header is similar to all kernels: ::

    from kernpart import kernpart
    import numpy as np

    class rational_quadratic(kernpart):

**__init__(self,input_dim, param1, param2, ...)**

The implementation of this function in mandatory.

For all kernparts the first parameter ``input_dim`` corresponds to the dimension of the input space, and the following parameters stand for the parameterization of the kernel.

The following attributes are compulsory: ``self.input_dim`` (the dimension, integer), ``self.name`` (name of the kernel, string), ``self.num_params`` (number of parameters, integer). ::

    def __init__(self,input_dim,variance=1.,lengthscale=1.,power=1.):
        assert input_dim == 1, "For this kernel we assume input_dim=1"
        self.input_dim = input_dim
        self.num_params = 3
        self.name = 'rat_quad'
        self.variance = variance
        self.lengthscale = lengthscale
        self.power = power

**_get_params(self)**

The implementation of this function in mandatory.

This function returns a one dimensional array of length ``self.num_params`` containing the value of the parameters. ::

    def _get_params(self):
        return np.hstack((self.variance,self.lengthscale,self.power))

**_set_params(self,x)**

The implementation of this function in mandatory.

The input is a one dimensional array of length ``self.num_params`` containing the value of the parameters. The function has no output but it updates the values of the attribute associated to the parameters (such as ``self.variance``, ``self.lengthscale``, ...). ::

    def _set_params(self,x):
        self.variance = x[0]
        self.lengthscale = x[1]
        self.power = x[2]

**_get_param_names(self)**

The implementation of this function in mandatory.

It returns a list of strings of length ``self.num_params`` corresponding to the parameter names. ::

    def _get_param_names(self):
        return ['variance','lengthscale','power']

**K(self,X,X2,target)**

The implementation of this function in mandatory.

This function is used to compute the covariance matrix associated with the inputs X, X2 (np.arrays with arbitrary number of line (say :math:`n_1`, :math:`n_2`) and ``self.input_dim`` columns). This function does not returns anything but it adds the :math:`n_1 \times n_2` covariance matrix to the kernpart to the object ``target`` (a :math:`n_1 \times n_2` np.array). This trick allows to compute the covariance matrix of a kernel containing many kernparts with a limited memory use. ::

    def K(self,X,X2,target):
        if X2 is None: X2 = X
        dist2 = np.square((X-X2.T)/self.lengthscale)
        target += self.variance*(1 + dist2/2.)**(-self.power)

**Kdiag(self,X,target)**

The implementation of this function in mandatory.

This function is similar to ``K`` but it computes only the values of the kernel on the diagonal. Thus, ``target`` is a 1-dimensional np.array of length :math:`n_1`. ::

    def Kdiag(self,X,target):
        target += self.variance    


**dK_dtheta(self,dL_dK,X,X2,target)**

This function is required for the optimization of the parameters.

Computes the derivative of the likelihood. As previously, the values are added to the object target which is a 1-dimensional np.array of length ``self.input_dim``. For example, if the kernel is parameterized by :math:`\sigma^2,\ \theta`, then :math:`\frac{dL}{d\sigma^2} = \frac{dL}{d K} \frac{dK}{d\sigma^2}` is added to the first element of target and :math:`\frac{dL}{d\theta} = \frac{dL}{d K} \frac{dK}{d\theta}` to the second. ::

    def dK_dtheta(self,dL_dK,X,X2,target):
        if X2 is None: X2 = X
        dist2 = np.square((X-X2.T)/self.lengthscale)

        dvar = (1 + dist2/2.)**(-self.power)
        dl = self.power * self.variance * dist2 * self.lengthscale**(-3) * (1 + dist2/2./self.power)**(-self.power-1)
        dp = - self.variance * np.log(1 + dist2/2.) * (1 + dist2/2.)**(-self.power)

        target[0] += np.sum(dvar*dL_dK)
        target[1] += np.sum(dl*dL_dK)
        target[2] += np.sum(dp*dL_dK)


**dKdiag_dtheta(self,dL_dKdiag,X,target)**

This function is required for BGPLVM, sparse models and uncertain inputs.

As previously, target is an ``self.num_params`` array and :math:`\frac{dL}{d Kdiag} \frac{dKdiag}{dparam}` is added to each element. ::

    def dKdiag_dtheta(self,dL_dKdiag,X,target):
        target[0] += np.sum(dL_dKdiag)
        # here self.lengthscale and self.power have no influence on Kdiag so target[1:] are unchanged

**dK_dX(self,dL_dK,X,X2,target)**

This function is required for GPLVM, BGPLVM, sparse models and uncertain inputs.

Computes the derivative of the likelihood with respect to the inputs ``X`` (a :math:`n \times d` np.array). The result is added to target which is a :math:`n \times d` np.array. ::

    def dK_dX(self,dL_dK,X,X2,target):
        """derivative of the covariance matrix with respect to X."""
        if X2 is None: X2 = X
        dist2 = np.square((X-X2.T)/self.lengthscale)

        dX = -self.variance*self.power * (X-X2.T)/self.lengthscale**2 *  (1 + dist2/2./self.lengthscale)**(-self.power-1)
        target += np.sum(dL_dK*dX,1)[:,np.newaxis]

**dKdiag_dX(self,dL_dKdiag,X,target)**

This function is required for BGPLVM, sparse models and uncertain inputs. As for ``dKdiag_dtheta``, :math:`\frac{dL}{d Kdiag} \frac{dKdiag}{dX}` is added to each element of target. ::

    def dKdiag_dX(self,dL_dKdiag,X,target):
        pass

**Psi statistics**

The psi statistics and their derivatives are required for BGPLVM and GPS with uncertain inputs.

The expressions of the psi statistics are:

For the rational quadratic we have:

Update the constructor 
======================

Once the required functions have been implemented as a kernpart object, the file GPy/kern/constructors.py has to be updated to allow to build a kernel based on the kernpart object.

The following line should be added in the preamble of the file::

    from rational_quadratic import rational_quadratic as rational_quadratic_part

as well as the following block ::

    def rational_quadratic(input_dim,variance=1., lengthscale=1., power=1.):
        part = rational_quadraticpart(input_dim,variance, lengthscale, power)
        return kern(input_dim, [part])


Update initialization
=====================

The last step is to update the list of kernels imported from constructor in GPy/kern/__init__.py.
